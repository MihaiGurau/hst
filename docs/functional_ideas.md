# Functional project ideas

This document contains various functional that I should / could / might implement in the project.

## Charts and portfolio analysis

Adding charts that show what industry was most traded,

## Volume alerts

Consider triggering alerts when the volume to be traded exceeds what the company was worth
or the total traded volume on that date.

## More trading parameters

- [ ] daily / monthly trade frequency
- [ ] do not trade on day X if all selected stocks went down on day X
- [ ] choose to trade the best / second best / third best stock on a given day
- [ ] what about the worst ones? how quickly could you run out of money (**this might be out of scope**)
